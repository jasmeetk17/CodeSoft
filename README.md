# Codesoft Virtual Internship

Welcome to the Codesoft Virtual Internship! In this internship, you will complete three tasks using Python: a calculator, a password generator, and a to-do list application. This README file provides an overview of the tasks, the libraries used, and how to run each project.

## Tasks Overview

### 1. Calculator

A simple calculator application that can perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

### 2. Password Generator

A secure password generator that allows users to create strong passwords. The generated passwords can be copied to the clipboard for easy use.

### 3. To-Do List

A to-do list application that allows users to add, delete, and view their tasks. This helps users keep track of their daily tasks and improve productivity.

## Libraries Used

- **tkinter:** Used for creating graphical user interfaces for the applications. It provides various widgets to create buttons, labels, entry boxes, and more.
- **random:** Used in the password generator to generate random characters for creating strong passwords.
- **tkinter.messagebox:** Used in the to-do list application for displaying warning messages and confirmation dialogs.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have Python installed on your system. You can download it from [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

### Installation

Clone the repository to your local machine:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/your-repo/codesoft-virtual-internship.git
cd codesoft-virtual-internship
```

### Running the Applications

Each task is contained in its own folder within the repository. Follow the instructions below to run each application.

#### Calculator

1. Navigate to the calculator folder:

   ```sh
   cd calculator
   ```

2. Run the calculator script:

   ```sh
   python calculator.py
   ```

#### Password Generator

1. Navigate to the password generator folder:

   ```sh
   cd password_generator
   ```

2. Run the password generator script:

   ```sh
   python password_generator.py
   ```

#### To-Do List

1. Navigate to the to-do list folder:

   ```sh
   cd to_do_list
   ```

2. Run the to-do list script:

   ```sh
   python to_do_list.py
   ```

## Task Descriptions

### Calculator

The calculator application provides a graphical user interface (GUI) with buttons for numbers and arithmetic operations. Users can input calculations, view the results, and clear the input field. 

### Password Generator

The password generator application allows users to specify the length of the password they want to generate. It creates a password using a mix of characters and provides an option to copy the generated password to the clipboard for easy use.

### To-Do List

The to-do list application allows users to manage their tasks by adding new tasks, deleting individual tasks, deleting all tasks, sorting tasks, choosing a random task, and displaying the number of tasks. It features a user-friendly GUI to facilitate these operations.
